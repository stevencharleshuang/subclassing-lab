# Subclasses With Animals Lab

## Introduction

In this lab, you will be using your knowledge of classes to build an `Animal` class, complete with properties, getters, and setters. After completing the class, you'll then create subclasses of `Animal` called `Mammal` and `Reptile`. Finally, you'll create at least one subclass of `Mammal` and one subclass of `Reptile`, making them whatever animals you want.

Each subclass should have some unique property that differentiates it from its parent class. For instance, a reptile could have a Boolean to determine if it has a shell, or a snake could have a Boolean to determine if it is poisonous.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Create an `Animal` class with the following properties set in the constructor:  `topSpeed`, `isEndangered`, and `name`.
- Create subclasses of `Animal` called `Mammal` and `Reptile`.
- Create at least one subclass of `Mammal` and one subclass of `Reptile`.
- Each subclass must have something that makes it unique from its parent class.
- Create a `Main` class with a `main()` method.
- Initialize a list of animals, adding different types of mammals and reptiles to it.

Your primary objective is to practice everything that was covered in the lesson. Also, try to break your code, debug it, and learn from the exceptions you get.

**Bonus:** Create more than the minimum number of `Mammal` or `Reptile` subclasses.

#### Starter Code

There is no starter code for this lab.
